# MSCS Ready
A year-long Readiness Sequence of six instructional modules is available to prepare those without undergraduate computer science degrees to enter the Master's of Computer Science program at Clemson.

## Modules:
1. **Module 1 - Procedural Programming**<br>
This course focuses on software development fundamentals: the software development process including the design and simple analysis of algorithms, fundamental programming concepts and data structures and basic software development and tools.<br>
*Programming language and environment: **C and Unix***

2. **Module 2 - Object-Oriented Programming**<br>
This course focuses on object-oriented programming: classes and objects, information hiding and encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Continued emphasis on problem solving and program development technique for typical numerical, nonnumerical, and data processing problems. Introduces basic data structures, use of recursion, and file i/o, simple searching and sorting.<br>
*Programming language and environment: **C and C++; Unix/Linux***

3. **Module 3 - Discrete Structures**<br>
This course introduces ideas and techniques from discrete structures that are widely used in the computing sciences. Topics include finite state machines; regular expressions; functions, relations and sets; symbolic logic; proof techniques; counting arguments (sum and product rules, inclusion-exclusion principle; arithmetic/geometric progressions); pigeonhole principle; computation of combinations and permutations; the computer as state machine.<br>

4. **Module 4 - Algorithms and Data Structures**<br>
This course addresses the study of data structures and algorithms fundamental to computer science; abstract data-type concepts; data structures including lists, stacks, queues, trees, hashtables and graphs; measures of program running time and time complexity; algorithm analysis and design techniques.<br>
*Programming language and environment: **C and C++; Unix/Linux***

5. **Module 5 - Computer Organization**<br>
This course focuses on the building blocks and structure of computers, networks and the internet. Topics include machine representation of different types of data, how instructions are represented at both the machine level and in the context of a symbolic assembler, the principles of memory management and memory hierarchy, and how computer programs organize memory. Students will write simple programs at the assembly/machine level and will be able to describe basic properties of system performance.<br>
*Programming language and environment: **C, ARM assembly language; Unix/Linux***

6. **Module 6 - Operating Systems**<br>
This course focuses on management techniques for the control of computer hardware resources. Topics include interrupt processing, primitive level characteristics of hardware and the management of memory, processors, devices, and data. Students who complete this course will be able to describe the basic components of a computer operating system, discuss the impact of the process-scheduling algorithm used by an operating system, use synchronization services provided by an operating system to implement a multithreaded application program, and discuss the issues involved in virtual memory support in a modern computer system.<br>
*Programming language and environment: **C and C++; Unix/Linux***
